# Web Scraping Independent Project – Scrapethissite.com  
**Real & Working Web Scraper Built from Scratch (November 2025)**

### What This Project Does (Simple Explanation)
This is my first fully independent web scraping project.  
I built a Python script that automatically visits:  
https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/simple/  
and extracts real-time data of all countries:
- Country Name
- Capital City
- Population

The data is saved instantly into a clean CSV file (`countries.csv`).

### Why I Built This
To prove I can do **real web scraping** from zero — no tutorial copy-paste, fully understood and working 100%.

This is the exact skill needed for social media data collection (TikTok, Instagram, Xiao Hong Shu) and automation tasks.

### Tools Used
- Python
- `requests` – to open the website
- `BeautifulSoup` – to read and extract the data
- CSV – to save the results automatically

### How to Run (Very Easy)
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
python scraper.py
